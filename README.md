DESCRIPTION :Automated report generation is the process of using software tools and scripts to automatically collect, analyze, and present data in a structured report format without manual intervention. This task typically involves pulling data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or spreadsheets, processing it according to predefined rules or metrics, and formatting it into a readable documentâ€”such as a PDF, Excel file, or interactive dashboard. Automation ensures reports are generated consistently, on time, and with minimal human error. It is widely used in business analytics, finance, marketing, and operations to deliver real-time or scheduled insights, saving time and increasing efficiency. Tools like Python (with libraries like Pandas, ReportLab, and Jinja2), Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, and Google Data Studio are commonly used to build and schedule these automated reporting systems.
